    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire(modern-day Croatia)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1861</strong> - Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1870</strong> - Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1873</strong> - Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1878</strong> -  Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of college.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1882</strong> - Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company

        <strong>1884</strong> - Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.
